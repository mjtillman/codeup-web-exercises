    Positioning
        Relative Position:
        only applies to one element, does not affect rest of the page
            up, down, left, right
            right: 10px;
                pushes box 10 pixels to the left (pushing from the right)
                negative values are valid
            right: -10px;
                pushes box 10 pixels to the right (negative)

        Absolute Positioning:
            removes element out of the document flow

        Fixed Positioning:
            Removes element from document flow and does not move with scrolling
